"Hi Lisa, good morning. Oh, I'm sorry to hear you were sick yesterday. I really hope you feel better today.

Don't worry, I thought you were busy working or studying, and I didn't want to disturb you. Also, I don't want to make you feel like you have to write to me every day. Feel free to do so or not; I actually enjoy talking with you a lot. But, as I said, feel free

Yes, my work is going well. Actually, these days have been easier than other days when there was a lot of work to do, so I'm happy to have time to work on my own projects.


Amazing! It must be very interesting to have your own jewelry store in London, an amazing city with so many interesting people who like jewelry. Certainly, it's a great place to have a jewelry store, but I would also guess it's very competitive. It doesn't sound easy to manage and compete, but definitely, a feeling of worthiness at the end of the day must feel great

Congratulations for your courage and determination, there is a lot of passion when you undertake


I'm working on a personal website, it's not ready yet, but I really enjoy the process of programming and building functional apps with code. It's relaxing for me to be concentrated in front of a computer and also a creative way to express and solve problems

Many thanks! And... yes! Definitely, we should live our lives with meaning. I love knowing that you are very happy with your work and lifestyle


I was wondering if you know any Spanish, or if you are studying it?

Well, fortunately, knowing Spanish isn't that required in the world. I hope you learn some words or expressions in Spanish before you end your travel to Chile

Sure, learning a new language definitely increases your cognition and broadens your understanding of different cultures through their language, especially if we are aware that translations can betray or subtly distort the original meaning, which we wouldn't like to miss.

Actually, I'm constantly practicing English because I want to learn it perfectly, and my level isn't that good yet.

After all I want to become a citizen of the world and travel around the world

Now I'm going to prepare to do some exercise before going swimming in the pool. I won't be attentive to my phone, but if you write something, I'll respond to you later

hahahha you make me blush, I mean, you don't have to do it, I really appreciate your morning greetings, you make the day nicer, but you are getting me used to it, and the last thing I want is for you to feel obligated
